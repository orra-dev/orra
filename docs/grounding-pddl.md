# PDDL for Execution Plan Validation in Orra

**Only applies when grounding is applied to a project in Orra.**

## Core Validation Guarantee
Every execution plan must satisfy both:
- PDDL domain constraints
- Concrete service capability requirements through grounding

No plan executes without passing both validations.

## Recursive Validation Flow
1. PDDL Domain Validation
    - Validates action sequences
    - Ensures state transitions
    - Verifies preconditions and effects
    - Guards against invalid state transformations
    - Enforces temporal ordering constraints

2. Grounding Validation
    - Maps abstract actions to concrete services
    - Validates service capabilities against target grounding use case via embeddings
    - Confirms semantic compatibility
    - Ensures runtime capability alignment
    - Handles service versioning and updates

## Implementation

### Domain Definition
```pddl
(define (domain service-operations)
  (:predicates
    (service-ready ?s)
    (operation-complete ?s)
  )
  (:action execute-service
    :parameters (?s)
    :precondition (service-ready ?s)
    :effect (operation-complete ?s)
  )
)
```

## Safety Properties
- Invalid plans fail fast during validation
- Runtime capability verification ensures service compatibility
- Semantic correctness guaranteed through domain rules
- No execution without valid grounding
- Handles service updates and version changes gracefully
- Maintains execution consistency across distributed services

## Why This Matters
- Prevents runtime failures from invalid plans
- Enables dynamic service selection and replacement
- Ensures semantic correctness in multi-agent systems
- Provides formal verification guarantees
- Supports evolution of service capabilities
