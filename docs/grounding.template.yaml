# Domain Grounding Template
#
# Use this template to create domain grounding specs for your project.
# The spec includes use cases that help Orra generate better execution
# plans by grounding the planner in your specific domain.
#
# Tips for using with LLMs to generate a grounding a spec with useful use cases:
# 1. Describe your domain and typical actions
# 2. List your available services and their capabilities
# 3. Ask the LLM to generate specs following this format
# 4. Review and adjust the generated specs

# Unique name for this grounding spec (e.g., "customer-support")
name: "your-grounding-spec-name"

# Main domain these grounding use cases belong to (e.g., "e-commerce-customer-support")
domain: "your-domain-name"

# Semantic version of these use cases
version: "1.0"

# Use cases of actions in your domain
use-cases:
  # Use case 1: Simple action pattern
  - action: "Verb action for achieving something"
    params:
      variable: "example-value"                       # Example values for the variables
      context: "additional-context"                   # Any additional parameters needed
    capabilities:                                     # List required capabilities
      - "Core capability needed"                      # Keep capabilities atomic and specific
      - "Another required capability"
    intent: "Clear description of what this action aims to achieve"

  # Use case 2: More complex action pattern
  - action: "Verb {thing} with {context}"  # Use {braces} for variables in action text
    params:
      thing: "ITEM123"
      context: "CONTEXT456"
      extra: "optional-param"
    capabilities:
      - "Primary capability"
      - "Secondary capability"
    intent: "Clear description with any important variations or context"

# OPTIONAL: Business rules and limitations that apply to all actions
constraints:
  - "Important business rule to follow"
  - "Critical limitation to consider"
  - "Security or privacy requirement"

# NOTE: Delete all comments (lines starting with #) before using
