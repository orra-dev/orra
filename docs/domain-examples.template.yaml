# Domain Examples Template
#
# Use this template to create domain examples for your project.
# These examples help Orra generate better execution plans by grounding the planner
# in your specific domain.
#
# Tips for using with LLMs:
# 1. Describe your domain and typical actions
# 2. List your available services and their capabilities
# 3. Ask the LLM to generate examples following this format
# 4. Review and adjust the generated examples

# Unique name for this set of examples (e.g., "customer-support-examples")
name: "your-domain-examples"

# Main domain these examples belong to (e.g., "E-commerce Customer Support")
domain: "Your Domain Name"

# Semantic version of these examples

# Examples of actions in your domain
examples:
  # Example 1: Simple action pattern
  - action: "Verb action for {variable}"     # Use {braces} for variables in action text
    params:
      variable: "example-value"              # Example values for the variables
      context: "additional-context"          # Any additional parameters needed
    capabilities:                            # List required capabilities
      - "Core capability needed"             # Keep capabilities atomic and specific
      - "Another required capability"
    intent: "Clear description of what this action aims to achieve"

  # Example 2: More complex action pattern
  - action: "Verb {thing} with {context}"
    params:
      thing: "ITEM123"
      context: "CONTEXT456"
      extra: "optional-param"
    capabilities:
      - "Primary capability"
      - "Secondary capability"
    intent: "Clear description with any important variations or context"

# OPTIONAL: Business rules and limitations that apply to all actions
constraints:
  - "Important business rule to follow"
  - "Critical limitation to consider"
  - "Security or privacy requirement"
