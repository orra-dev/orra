## Plan Engine v0.2.6

### Features
- Anonymous Telemetry: the Plan Engine now collects minimal, privacy-preserving usage analytics to help improve the project.
  - All telemetry is fully anonymous: no personal data, no IP addresses, and no environment details are collected.
  - Only hashed project and execution plan IDs are used for tracking related events.
  - Telemetry is opt-out at any time by setting ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY=false in your environment or .env file.
