## Tips From Production

Having deployed agent architectures in production, here's what to watch for:

- Start small (Echo example) before tackling complex workflows
- Always implement proper error handling and graceful shutdowns
- Monitor your service health and orchestration status using `orra inspect`
- Keep your Mistral/OpenAI API keys secure and never commit them
